# README.md for gfobh

## Background

## Inspiration


## Principles
* Try to avoid use of libraries, especially non-standard libraries. For example as great as it is generally avoid using the core library for OCaml

## Languages
The following languages are those for which exercises are built in rough order of likelihood I have or will do an exercise (i.e., nearly always there will be an example done in C and OCaml; nearly never will there be one for C++ or Haskell):
* C
* OCaml
* Clojure
* JavaScript (ECMAScript 6)
* Swift
* Python
* C#
* Java
* C++
* Haskell

## Git and Github
Generally I will [guide to git and branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)

## Markdown
These notes are written in markdown. Here's a guide to [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Language Notes
### JavaScript
